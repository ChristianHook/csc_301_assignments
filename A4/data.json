Does a cute little twirly dance when excited, especially at meal times. Not a snuggler, but enjoys laying by your side or on your lap getting rub downs."},

	"bio" : "Snow is a 5-year-old Bully/Boxer mix weighing 45#. She is a lot smaller than she looks, which makes her the perfect lap dog. Snow loves belly rubs, snuggles, and occasionally a good game of tug of war. She is kid friendly, but would do best with older children. She is crate trained and house trained. She is dog friendly, but prefers low-energy dogs like herself. Snow goes to basic obedience classes which are free to her for life!"},
